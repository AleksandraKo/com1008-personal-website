                       Hi and Welcome to my website! My name is Aleksandra Kovaleva
                       and I am a first year Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science 
                       student.
                    </p>
                    <p class="boxes yellow">
                        I haven't always wanted to do Computer Science. In fact, my career 
                        path was so uncertain, that at first, I wanted to be a Landscape 
                        Designer, then I wanted to study economics in Germany and then, 
                        when I was In year 12, I decided that is still not what I want to do.

                        So I spent many days trying to figure out the route I wanted to go, 
                        until I managed to get work experience at

                        - an AI company that develops software and processors for Machine 
                        Learning. After a week of shadowing and looking at their inner processes I 
                        felt like that was the path I wanted to take. The exciting 
                        opportunities of the field seemed extremely enticing and with all of 
                        the possible revolutionary ideas - it seemed like the perfect place for me.

                        As I was missing Maths A-level, I had to take a foundation year - 
                        which is what brought me to the Sheffield University. Now, two 
                        years later after that week at GraphCore, I finally am on the right 
                        path. So let me tell you a bit more about my courseâ€¦
