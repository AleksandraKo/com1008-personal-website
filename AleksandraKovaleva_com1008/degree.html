                        This module teaches us Software Engineering concepts, what goes 
                        into developing it and how to work in a team. Part of the assessment 
                        is a group project where we will develop a software. That will involve
                        creating a platform to connect Mentors and Mentees. 
                        We also learn Ruby whilst solving small problems on a fun and an 
                        interactive platform called Codio.

                        This module helps us to develop mathematical concepts and techniques 
                        that are crucial to the understanding of programming and computing. 
                        This involves learning about Propositional and Predicate logic, sets 
                        and Boolean algebra that is later assessed through quizzes.

                    <p class="boxes pink">
                        In this module we learn the Java Programming Language by watching 
                        lectures and completing short exercises after each lecture. Starting 
                        at 0 knowledge we learn the basics of Java, as well as good 
                        practices of commenting and the ability to solve problems concisely. 
                        We complete quizzes and assignments which involve writing programs.

                        An introductory course to Artificial Intelligence, where in the first 
                        half of the Autumn Semester we learn about the history of AI, Turing 
                        test, Intelligent and Logical Agents. The second half we learn about 
                        Vision and Robotics. As well as lectures and quizzes, we also use 
                        MiROCloud - a simulation where we can program a robot.

                    <p class="boxes yellow">
                        This is an autumn semester module that teaches us the basics of 
                        networks, interworking and information security. It also takes us 
                        through the process of creating a website and how to use html, 
                        css and java to do so. 80% of the module mark comes from creating 
                        this website.
